## Redux Minesweeper

This is a personal project of a minesweeper game I built using Redux.<br>
The reason behind adopting Redux instead using some simpler framework like MobX, for example, was educational only. After studying Redux, I decided to implment a bit of it in a project. That is an overkill though. <br>
It was created using `create-react-app`.
